## 📖 Overview

**Polymarket Prediction Bot** is a **Polymarket trading bot for prediction markets** — a
keyboard-driven **terminal dashboard** for [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/), the
**Polygon-based prediction market** with a central-limit order book (CLOB) and USDC
settlement. It bundles a markets browser, a live CLOB order-book view, a strategy engine
and a position/fill tracker into one pane — a complete **Polymarket CLOB API client
(REST + WebSocket)** in your terminal.

Polymarket shares resolve YES/NO to $1/$0 on real events: elections, crypto milestones,
sports, macro prints. Pricing a share *is* pricing a probability — the bot runs **edge
detection and liquidity provision strategies** against a fair-probability model, surfaces
**cross-market arbitrage signals (YES+NO spread, multi-outcome)**, and keeps **position
tracking and PnL history** with **risk limits and exposure controls**. A **paper trading
mode with virtual USDC balance** lets you iterate safely. **Terminal UI built with Textual
and Rich** — an **educational open-source toolkit, no financial advice**.

> ⚠️ Paper-trade by default. `--demo` simulates fills against a bundled dataset. Live order
> placement requires your own Polymarket API credentials and is gated behind explicit
> configuration.

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sabinastone7/Polymarket-Trading-Bot.git
cd Polymarket-Trading-Bot
pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py --demo     # paper-trade bundled dataset
python main.py            # live mode (needs API credentials)
```

One-click launchers (no system Python required — they unpack a bundled standalone
interpreter on first run):

```batch
run.bat        :: Windows
```
```bash
chmod +x run.sh && ./run.sh    # Linux / macOS
```

## ⚙️ Live mode credentials

```toml
# ~/.polymarket-bot/config.toml
[auth]
private_key   = "0x…"          # Polygon EOA private key (chmod 0600!)
proxy_address = "0x…"          # Polymarket proxy/signer address
api_key       = "…"
api_secret    = "…"
api_passphrase= "…"
endpoint      = "https://clob.polymarket.com"
```

Credentials are read only from the config file (mode 0600). Never commit them.

## 🧠 Strategy engine

Built-in strategies (selectable, composable):

- **Probability-edge** — compares market price to a fair-probability model and signals when
  the edge exceeds a threshold.
- **Book-imbalance** — large YES/NO size skew as a directional cue.
- **Liquidity** — wide-spread mean-reversion toward mid.

Each signal carries a confidence `0..1` and a suggested side. The bot logs every signal; in
live mode you wire a strategy to an order template.
